## "Fly Mode"; or, How to Configure Your Controller

On some controllers included with drone kits (namely the Flysky `FS-i6S`), there exists a mostly undocumented mode called "Fly Mode". If your controller has this mode, it will be visible quite plainly on the home screen:

Although it may seem intuitive to enable this mode, ***ABSOLUTELY DON'T***. If Fly Mode is enabled the drone will behave erratically and has been known to take off at high speeds in random directions.
