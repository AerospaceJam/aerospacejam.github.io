# Creating Project Structure

## Prerequisites

For this guide, you'll need:

- A computer with the tools from previous parts of this guide installed

## Creating a folder and initializing Git

- Open your file manager and find a location for your files. It doesn't matter where you place them - they can go anywhere you want.
- Create a folder in this location, and give it a name - it also can be whatever you want, but I recommend something along the lines of "AerospaceJam" or "AerospaceJam2024".
- Right click your new folder and select "Open with Code". If you're prompted about security, select "Yes, I trust the author".
- From the top context menus, select `Terminal > New terminal`.

- Now, a terminal will appear in the bottom of the screen. In this terminal, type the following command and press enter:
  
  ```sh
  git init
  ```
