description: A quick rundown of the sensors and microcontrollers you've recieved in your kit.
---

# What's in the box?

This year, your kit will include:

- A Raspberry Pi Pico-W microcontroller with a rechargable battery power supply
- An AS7341 color sensor
- An RFID reader and an RFID tag
- A TF-Luna LIDAR module
- An external thermometer

And, last but not least, your actual Minds-I drone kit.

Throughout this guide, you won't work with these sensors - you'll get them working later. For now, we're just going to focus on getting your microcontroller up and running.

:::warning

This guide focuses on the microcontroller only, but all future guides assume you've already built your drone kit - you can do so by following the included instructions.
