# Introduction

The Aerospace Jam is a competition for high school teams across Wisconsin to use drones on a NASA-inspired simulated Lunar mission. The program is co-sponsored by the NASA Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium and the Milwaukee Bucks. Our goal is to recruit students from diverse backgrounds and cultivate a welcoming and inclusive event that will foster meaningful interactions among teammates and teams.
